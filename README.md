## 🚨 The Silent Killer

**Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer**, often detected too late. Every year, it silently claims thousands of lives. But what if detection could happen earlier? What if AI could be the difference?

**Enter PancreAI**—a powerful, intelligent solution built to detect pancreatic cancer risks early, provide explainable insights, and empower patients and clinicians alike with timely, life-saving information.

## 🌟 How PancreAI Works

PancreAI works its magic through **four core capabilities**:

1. **🧪 Risk Assessment:** Rapid evaluation of pancreatic cancer risk using demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data.  
2. **🔍 Explainable Insights:** Uses Cohere’s Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to clearly break down contributing risk factors.  
3. **🖼️ Advanced Imaging Analysis:** Enhances diagnostic accuracy through integrated CT scan analysis using Nvidia MONAI.
4. **💡 Actionable Recommendations:** Offers personalized, data-backed advice to encourage timely medical follow-ups.
